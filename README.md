# JavaOOPSoftUni
The Java OOP course will teach you the principles of 
object-oriented programming (OOP), how to work with 
classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, 
and build class hierarchies. You will learn the basic principles 
of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), 
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. We will delve 
into the most commonly used design patterns (design patterns). 
We will focus on Component Testing (writing unit tests) and the 
concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
